                        This visualization comes from Strava’s ‘Project Kodos’, a project in which the social media and exercise platform gives it users an intuitive and fun way to see their history of kudos, or likes, with their followers. Here, I have selected one of four options, this one displaying the other athletes (ie my friends and followers on strava) based on with whom I am in a kudos deficit. This means that all of these profile pictures shown here are people to whom I have given more kudos than they have given me. 
I love this visualization for a couple of reasons. First of all, its method of encoding data is very creative I believe. The size of the circular profile picture correlates with the magnitude of the deficit; that is to say, that the bigger the picture, the bigger the deficit. Then, cleverly, instead of using names or athlete IDs/usernames, the visualization uses the profile pictures of the other athletes—making this visualization much more personally relevant. Because each one of these visualizations is generated for an individual, that is a relevant and important feature. 
Also, I love that the visualization is interactive. I can toggle between my total kudos given by athlete, total received, deficit and surplus. I can also toggle to see this data in table form. Strava Labs makes this data very clear and easy to interact with. The interactivity, simplicity and clever encoding of data all make this visualization a true delight.

                        This visualization shows the relative difference in speaking times for male and female characters in Disney movies. This topic has been discussed for movies involving real actors, but I thought that it was interesting to see that the disparity in speaking time for male and female characters extends into the animated realm as well. This visualization utilizes position to compare how much speaking time male and female characters get in various movies, with the titles to the left of the bars. I also think that the use of colors and luminance is very effective here. For movies in which male characters have far more speaking time than females, the blue color is very bold, while the red color is more muted. When speaking time is approximately equal, the boldness of the colors is similar. For the movies with more female speaking time, the red stands out. I thought that this use of color was effective in further emphasizing the lack of female dialogue even in children's movies. Additionally, having the three categories in three columns further shows how many more movies have male voices dominating, compared to the very few films with equal speaking time or female-dominated dialogue. This visualization is certainly enlightening; while the speaking time of animated characters may not be a very critical issue to consider, it reflects more broadly on the issue of gender inequity in all categories.

                        This visualization plots both the numer of U.S. Wildfires, and the area burnt by wildfires, on a pair of inverted axes with a shared base.  From the very first look the image is striking and immediately digestable. The use of flame-themed colors and shading sells further the concept behind the graph: fire and the toll it takes, and is a clever example of an aesthetic choice that also adds clarity to the data being presented. I especially like this graph because there is a great underlying truth behind it - that despite the fact that the number of wildfires has fluctuated around the same level, the amount of area burnt has vastly risen with time. This shows that at the very least, either we have become poorer at mitigating wildires, or more concerningly that the intensity of wildires is increasing with time. This is perhaps yet more evidence of the natural severity that comes with climate change. In times like these where the west coast is being plagued by flames and smoke, this visualization becomes yet more important. The simplicity of this chart with just two variables plotted against time shines when we look at the deep story this data tells.                   </p>

                        For my good visualization, I chose this bar chart detailing deaths from coronavirus in Italy and the UK. I found this visualization to be very effective because it clearly shows the percent deceased is highest in those in their 80’s. This is an important visualization because it has the potential to save lives. If people who are 60+ in Italy or the UK see this visualization, it may convince them to stay at home and avoid risky social events by which they could catch the virus. In this sense, this visualization could save lives. 
                        This visualization is effective because it is quick and easy to understand, while conveying a large amount of information at the same time. A harmful impact of this visualization could be that if a 10-19 year old sees this visualization, they may take away the message that they are invincible and that there is “no chance” they could die from the virus. This may result in reckless behavior that could endanger them and spread the virus further, which harms communities and their country at large. Because of this, I believe it would be wise to show this graph to older viewers as a target audience.
                        When viewers see this visualization, they can easily identify extremes, make comparisons, and see trends in age all at once. It is truthful, functional, beautiful, insightful, and enlightening. The one thing I don’t like about this is that the difference between the way Italy and the UK are difficult to distinguish from one another. Italy is supposed to be lighter, but it is not a drastic enough difference to see at first glance.

                        While this visualization does communicate the intended message, I categorize it as a bad visualization because it had clear potential to communicate its message even more effectively than it already does. 
                        Taken from a recent meeting with a representative from UnitedWay Boston, this visualization depicts the HUD’s Annual Point-in-Time Count of homeless individuals in the US. The first bar in the graph shows the total, and then the subsequent bars show sub-categories that make up that total. The pie charts across the bottom, as indicated, show how each of those categories break into sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals respectively. 
                        I have a couple critiques of this visualization. First and foremost, the bar chart is not being used most effectively in this version of the visualization, and you will see in one of my proposed redesigns how I think it could be improved. It is not clear that the subsequent bars after the initial ‘overall’ bar in the bar chart are sub-categories, and not separate categories entirely. It would make more sense to either more clearly show that those other bars are combined to make the ‘overall’ bar, or just eliminate the ‘overall’ bar all together, and just let the other categories stand alone. 
                        Additionally, I find the pie charts to make the visualization a bit too crowded. This information could easily be encoded into the bar charts by coloring portions of the bars the different shades of blue to show the breakdown of sheltered and unsheltered.

                        This visualization is awful because the visualization itself is actually useless. It is a bar graph that is intended to show the difference in perceived vs. actual substance use among undergraduates at UCSB. The bar graphs do not accurately display the data, as it is simply the same bar graph for all substances and frequency of use. For example, the actual use of opiates 1-9 times per month is 0.7%, while the perceived use is 29.4%. This is obviously a massive difference, but you would never know that by looking at just the bars. For those using alcohol 1-9 times per month, the actual use was higher than the perceived use, but the bar meant to represent the actual use is still shorter than the bar for perceived use. Another element of this graph that I find problematic is that you need to read the paragraph at the top to understand what the red and white bars represent. It would have been far more clear to have a color-coded key next to the graphs so that readers know that the white bars are actual use, while the red bars are perceived use. I also think that it is not clear that "1-9 times," "10-29 times," and "daily" is in reference to use over one month, as this is mentioned in the paragraph above. While I think that the data behind this visualization is interesting, I think that it is presented really poorly.

                       This chart attempts to convey how different people surveyed draw the letter X, with a focus being on the order and direction in which they stencil the two strokes. At first glance this visualization looks good. It makes good use of just 2 colors and a plain background, and it is extremely easy to see what the most popular way of drawing an X is, with 55% of people doing a South-Eastward stroke first followed by a South-Westward one. Funnily enough, I found this graph on site while looking for good visualizations, but I was quickly put off by a major problem with it. This graph only shows the 4 most common ways of drawing X's, and for the remaining 4 ways we are given no context or differentiation on what each of these are, just the statistics on them. This incomplete legend is a serious detriment to the chart and prevents the reader from getting a full understanding of the data. Additionally, to add more ambiguity to an already ambiguous graph, each piece of data seems to be arbitrarily numbered. The numbers are most likely artefacts of the actual survey behind this data, but given that numbers 1-4 happen to be the least popular answers and were presented completely out of order, and that number 7 was the most common, it just makes this chart confusing. Finally, the chart initially has good intentions with size and attempts to use size to show maginitude, however it seems to give up on using size for the bottom four results again making this chart highly inconsistent.

                        This visualization intends to show the change in the NASA budget as a percentage of the federal budget. However, there is a lot that is unclear about its meaning, one uncertainty being the timeline over which these graphs take place. It appears to begin in the year 2000 but does not label any of the other charts with a year. '2020' is also oddly placed at the bottom of the graph and it is unclear what that is supposed to mean.
                        The NASA visualization does not follow any of the guidelines for effective visualizations. There are unnecessary design aspects that do not contribute to understanding the information portrayed. The random lines underneath the circle graphs do not add any information or further understanding -- and they actually do harm by adding clutter. To be aesthetically beautiful, visualizations should be free of any unnecessary elements. 
                        Another issue is that all three of the circle graphs shown look the exact same at first glance. When you look further at the details, you can see that the number of disks stacked on top of each other increases -- but it is difficult to make out. Visualizations should be readable and as easy as possible to understand, but this one is difficult to dissect meaning from at all. 
                        The tiny sliver of the circles that represent the NASA budget are also difficult to see. It does look like the sliver gets slightly smaller over time. However, it is difficult to draw that conclusion because the viewer must account for the fact that there are now additional disks stacked. Thus, it is difficult to consider this visualization insightful when it is so difficult to draw any meaningful patterns. Lastly, an additional issue with this graph is that the circles are 3 Dimensional. 3D shapes should be avoided in visualizations because they can misrepresent the size of data.

                    Above are my three redesigns. I think that the rightmost visualization is now the most effective; it emphasizes the relative difference in the perceived and actual substance use very clearly and minimally. I think that the other two visualizations are also more accurate than the original, because the relative sizes of the bars/filled circles are accurate, but the third visualization is the most minimal, which I think is more beautiful.

                    Here are my 3 redesigns for the chart on drawing X's. In all 3 redesigns, I made sure that my focus was to both remove the arbitrary numbering system, and to make sure that it was clear to the viewer what every different drawing method looked like. My favorite redesign was the left-most one, the bar chart, as it is a simple yet effective way of showign each option, and their magnitudes relative to one another. The second redesign was similar to the first but in the form of a scatter plot with the drawing method as glyphs, and the final redesign was an ordered heatmap where the drawing methods are presented in ascending order, and color can be added along with a legend to show magnitudes!

                    It is difficult to understand what message the NASA visualization is attempting to get across. It may be trying to show how the federal budget increases over time but the percentage going to NASA decreases, but that message is certainly not communicated effectively through the current layout. Pictured above are some redesigns that could better get this message across.
                    My first redesign is a line graph that more clearly illustrates the change in the federal budget versus the NASA budget. The first graph shows the percentage of the federal budget that NASA is given and the way it changes over time. From this line graph, the viewer can clearly see that the budget percentage NASA is given decreases over time.
                    The second redesign shows a clear comparison between the change in the federal budget and the change in the NASA budget, in millions of dollars. The graph shows that the federal budget increased sharply over time. However, the graph on the right shows that the NASA budget hardly increases at all over 20 years.
                    The redesign that I believe would be most effective is a stacked bar chart, pictured at the right. This shows the clear upward progression of the federal budget over time. The part of the bars that represents the NASA budget is clearly distinguishable by the different color. And by contrasting the way the larger bar gets bigger and the small red segment does not, the viewer can clearly conclude for themselves that the federal budget drastically increased over the years while the NASA budget stayed relatively stable. The compromise I had to make by choosing this graph is that it is difficult to see any change in the NASA budget segment because of how small it is (even though it did change by millions of dollars). But in context to the federal budget at large, it makes sense why it is difficult to make out any change.
