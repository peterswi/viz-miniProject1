                        This visualization comes from Strava’s ‘Project Kodos’, a project in which the social media and exercise platform gives it users an intuitive and fun way to see their history of kudos, or likes, with their followers. Here, I have selected one of four options, this one displaying the other athletes (ie my friends and followers on strava) based on with whom I am in a kudos deficit. This means that all of these profile pictures shown here are people to whom I have given more kudos than they have given me. 
I love this visualization for a couple of reasons. First of all, its method of encoding data is very creative I believe. The size of the circular profile picture correlates with the magnitude of the deficit; that is to say, that the bigger the picture, the bigger the deficit. Then, cleverly, instead of using names or athlete IDs/usernames, the visualization uses the profile pictures of the other athletes—making this visualization much more personally relevant. Because each one of these visualizations is generated for an individual, that is a relevant and important feature. 
Also, I love that the visualization is interactive. I can toggle between my total kudos given by athlete, total received, deficit and surplus. I can also toggle to see this data in table form. Strava Labs makes this data very clear and easy to interact with. The interactivity, simplicity and clever encoding of data all make this visualization a true delight.

                        This visualization shows the relative difference in speaking times for male and female characters in Disney movies. This topic has been discussed for movies involving real actors, but I thought that it was interesting to see that the disparity in speaking time for male and female characters extends into the animated realm as well. This visualization utilizes position to compare how much speaking time male and female characters get in various movies, with the titles to the left of the bars. I also think that the use of colors and luminance is very effective here. For movies in which male characters have far more speaking time than females, the blue color is very bold, while the red color is more muted. When speaking time is approximately equal, the boldness of the colors is similar. For the movies with more female speaking time, the red stands out. I thought that this use of color was effective in further emphasizing the lack of female dialogue even in children's movies. Additionally, having the three categories in three columns further shows how many more movies have male voices dominating, compared to the very few films with equal speaking time or female-dominated dialogue. This visualization is certainly enlightening; while the speaking time of animated characters may not be a very critical issue to consider, it reflects more broadly on the issue of gender inequity in all categories.

                        While this visualization does communicate the intended message, I categorize it as a bad visualization because it had clear potential to communicate its message even more effectively than it already does. 
                        Taken from a recent meeting with a representative from UnitedWay Boston, this visualization depicts the HUD’s Annual Point-in-Time Count of homeless individuals in the US. The first bar in the graph shows the total, and then the subsequent bars show sub-categories that make up that total. The pie charts across the bottom, as indicated, show how each of those categories break into sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals respectively. 
                        I have a couple critiques of this visualization. First and foremost, the bar chart is not being used most effectively in this version of the visualization, and you will see in one of my proposed redesigns how I think it could be improved. It is not clear that the subsequent bars after the initial ‘overall’ bar in the bar chart are sub-categories, and not separate categories entirely. It would make more sense to either more clearly show that those other bars are combined to make the ‘overall’ bar, or just eliminate the ‘overall’ bar all together, and just let the other categories stand alone. 
                        Additionally, I find the pie charts to make the visualization a bit too crowded. This information could easily be encoded into the bar charts by coloring portions of the bars the different shades of blue to show the breakdown of sheltered and unsheltered.

                        This visualization is awful because the visualization itself is actually useless. It is a bar graph that is intended to show the difference in perceived vs. actual substance use among undergraduates at UCSB. The bar graphs do not accurately display the data, as it is simply the same bar graph for all substances and frequency of use. For example, the actual use of opiates 1-9 times per month is 0.7%, while the perceived use is 29.4%. This is obviously a massive difference, but you would never know that by looking at just the bars. For those using alcohol 1-9 times per month, the actual use was higher than the perceived use, but the bar meant to represent the actual use is still shorter than the bar for perceived use. Another element of this graph that I find problematic is that you need to read the paragraph at the top to understand what the red and white bars represent. It would have been far more clear to have a color-coded key next to the graphs so that readers know that the white bars are actual use, while the red bars are perceived use. I also think that it is not clear that "1-9 times," "10-29 times," and "daily" is in reference to use over one month, as this is mentioned in the paragraph above. While I think that the data behind this visualization is interesting, I think that it is presented really poorly.

                    Above are my three redesigns. I think that the rightmost visualization is now the most effective; it emphasizes the relative difference in the perceived and actual substance use very clearly and minimally. I think that the other two visualizations are also more accurate than the original, because the relative sizes of the bars/filled circles are accurate, but the third visualization is the most minimal, which I think is more beautiful.
